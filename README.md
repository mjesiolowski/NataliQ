!! WEBSITE IN PROGRESS !!

This is my first commercial project, it presents the offer of an exclusive wedding dress salon. My goal was to make this website readible, easy to navigate, eye-catching, consisent and fully responsive.

To achieve my goal I implemented the following elements:
- highlighted navigation bar
- easily accesible categories (through: the navigation bar, animatend buton on the home page, dropdown menu on the subpages)
- easily accesible fixed social media bar on the right-hand side of the website
- an interactive modal to present the images
- a hamburger menu for the mobile support

Technology used:
